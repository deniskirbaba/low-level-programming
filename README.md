# Low-level programming course

## Laboratory work #1

Input/Output library in assembly. Implement a library of procedures that will perform simple manipulations with strings, numbers, and their textual representations.

Check out the documentation for the following instructions:
* *xor*
* *jmp, ja* and other conditional jump commands
* *cmp*
* *mov*
* *inc, dec*
* *add, imul, mul, sub, idiv, div*
* *neg*
* *call, ret*
* *push, pop*

Read the documentation for the *read* system call using *man*. Its number (which is put into *rax*) is 0.

Use *test.py* to test it work.
