# Low-level programming course

The course talks about programming languages in the context of building computing systems.

 * The basic concepts of computing systems, their complexity, decomposition, the concept of a computation model of a programming language are considered.
 * The main languages ​​of the course are Assembly and C.
 * The necessity of modularization of systems and abstraction of modules is substantiated.
 * The article considers tools for achieving these goals from the programmer's arsenal: client-service architecture, virtualization.
 * The concepts of syntax, semantics, pragmatics of the programming language are introduced.
 * The compilation cycle, linking and execution of programs on common computing systems are studied.
 * Common compiler optimizations and their impact on programming style are considered.

The course consists of:

 * 8 lectures
 * two labs on assembler
 * three labs on C
 * online course in C
 * 16 practical sessions (double, i.e. 8 meetings).
